title: Thoughts On Tumbling
---

<h2>This is from my old Tumblr</h2>

<p>I was Tumbling before it was cool.</p>



<p>Now I have returned to the platform with the introduction of <a href="http://robbie.io">robbie.io</a> (yes it&#8217;s not up yet, give DNS time). Sadly for such a nerdy domain, I have not figured out what nerdy things I am going to do with it yet. For now the best I can offer is the Github link on the left side, and letting you know this post has been written in Markdown.</p>



<p>I tried to get myself to write blog posts at <a href="http://blog.robbiet.us">blog.robbiet.us</a> once a week. I did it for two weeks, wrote two great pieces (about <a href="http://blog.robbiet.us/2011/03/09/verifone-bag-of-dicks/">Square</a> and <a href="http://blog.robbiet.us/2011/03/18/npr-congress-and-you/">NPR</a>) and then forgot about it. I have just set an event in my iCal to remind me daily to write or upload something. I generate so much content every day, mostly via Facebook and Twitter, some of it has to be of use on Tumblr too.</p>



<p>I think for the time being, this site will remain as a Tumblr (or tumblelog if you are old enough to remember). It may migrate to something cool down the road, like Jekyll or Chyrp.</p>



<p>What am I working on right now?</p>

  <li><p>A few interesting side projects, including a Minecraft blog that I am running with a friend</p></li>

<p>Keep your eyes peeled&#8230;</p>
