I had a very awesome and not so awesome year in 2011. I thought I would let you, the reader, know what big events happened in my life this year.

Good things:

*   I moved to an amazing new [apartment](http://www.livethegrand.com/) in Oakland, California
*   I started my own company, [Sutter Studios](http://sutterstudios.com) with friends.
*   I won two hackathons, [Code for Oakland](http://codeforoakland.org/code-for-oakland-2011-the-winners-list/) and the [TwilioCon Hackathon](http://www.twilio.com/blog/2011/09/announcing-the-finalists-from-the-twiliocon-hackathon.html), both of which I am very proud of.
*   I met an absolutely amazing amount of new people and friends this year, mostly thanks to the startup life.
*   I joined a company, [Momentum](http://momentumapp.co) which helps to bring change to the world. I am proud of what I am accomplishing already and the people I am helping.
*   I learned JavaScript, both client and server side
*   I committed a metric ton of code to [GitHub](http://github.com/robbiet480), open sourced a good chunk of it. I am very proud of that.
*   I like to thing I helped out quite a bit with Occupy Oakland and helping cover the events that happened there
*   I (almost, I'm so close!) successfully completed the 501c3 application process for my hackerspace, [Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org)
*   I travelled via airplane 15,567 miles, according to my [TripIt](http://tripit.com) account (trust me, this is a big deal for me since I love travel. Also, buy TripIt Pro, it's worth every penny)
*   I tried to be more outgoing and not always staying home. I think I succeeded somewhat but there is room to improve.
*   (Really big deal for me): I tweeted over 4000 things this year! Last year I ended with just under 4000 tweets, this year I have over 8000! That's insane to me.
*   (Also a kinda big deal): I got over 400 friends on Facebook. 

Not so good things:

*   I was too trusting of certain people this year who ended up hurting me greatly, both emotionally and financially. I am, some would say sadly, more guarded with myself then ever before.
*   My bank account went negative... about 30 times
*   I lost some friends simply because I neglected them due to the startup and my life. I am trying to get back on track with them.
*   I owe the IRS quite a bit of money
*   I owe friends and family quite a bit of money
*   I gained a _lot_ of weight which I absolutely hate myself for.
*   Outside of the weight issue, I neglected my health this year.
*   I spent way too much money. Like, you have no idea. There were quite a few times when I wasn't sure where the next check was coming from and didn't eat much for a few days.
*   I am pretty sure that I had depression for a good chunk of the year but I worked through it and am much better now
*   I'm sure I'm going to get shit for this but when Steve Jobs died it really hit me hard for some reason. That week or two really sucked hard.

So, there it is, all laid out. I thought when I started writing this blog post a while ago that I would just become depressed again when I saw the list of bad things was bigger then the pros list (it's 11 good and 9 bad things), but I'm not. I am _very_ proud of my accomplishments this year, so much so that it is inspiring me to do better this coming year, 2012. So, my goals for this coming year are as follows.

*   Lose weight, get down to a much better size, less then what I weighed before I gained it all. Do it by going to that nice gym you have in your apartment building
*   Get in a much more financially stable place. Make a budget, stick to it.
*   Get much better at personal time management
*   In the same vein, get more organized
*   Clean my room (no, really)
*   Join or create a company which gets funding and launches products. [Sutter Studios](http://sutterstudios.com) is already well down this path which is exciting
*   Start going outdoor more. Stop spending so much time in front of the computer
*   Learn a new language. No, not a programming language, a real language. Well, maybe a programming language too. 
*   Write more often. A long term goal of mine is to someday really use this blog to its full potential and end up in the Recommended section of [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com), on the top of [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) or [Reddit](http://reddit.com)
*   Produce music again. I never released what I did a few years ago but IMHO it was pretty good. Keep an eye out for a new track I am releasing, January 1st. It's just me dipping my toe in again.
*   Learn to cook for myself and cook well enough to impress others (also see goal 1). 
*   (Big one): Pay back everyone whether it be friends, family or the IRS (maybe the IRS should be first though...)
*   Take my sister to Europe, both because she always wanted to go and because I absolutely love it there. (Long-term goal, consider moving to Amsterdam)
*   Complete that pesky 501c3 paperwork for [Ace Monster Toys](http://acemonstertoys.org). Also, be a better secretary to them so that [Al](http://openbuddha.com) stops getting on my case
*   Remember how I said I have 400+ Facebook friends now? I want 800 by the end of 2012.
*   I want to make it through the [Mayan Calendar Rollover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon#Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar) (i'm kidding people, I don't believe in this.)

That's a lot of goals, I know. But I have 365 days to achieve them all. I think I can achieve most if not all of them by December 31, 2012.

2012 is going to be absolutely amazing. I can't wait. I am going to have a whole new set of challenges, adventures and experiences. This year was meh, next year will be win. This year also marks my 21st birthday which I am very excited for. 

To my friends, family and colleagues and to you, dear reader, I wish you a very very Happy New Year. Thank you for making 2011 amazing for me.

To me, since I know I'm going to see this alot, How many goals have you achieved this year so far? That's not enough DO MORE FASTER DAMNIT. When you read this, did you look like [this](http://d37nnnqwv9amwr.cloudfront.net/photos/images/newsfeed/000/210/983/okay.JPG)?
