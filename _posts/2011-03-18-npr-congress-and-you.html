<p>I'm going to preface this whole thing by asking you to FIRST watch this video. It is conveinently embedded below. Go on, just click play</p>

<p>Horrified? Not so much? If you answered "Not so much" get out. Right now.</p>

<p>Otherwise, continue reading.</p>

<p>(Please also note, this conversation mostly applies to PBS as well, just do s/NPR/PBS/ and you can figure it out. Both of them are funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, you can also put their name in instead).</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a big brou-ha-ha in Congress about defunding NPR because it uses "so much money" (in reality, federal funding at NPR only makes up 8% of their budget). I am a strong supporter of NPR. NPR provides extremely valuable coverage of news and current events on the radio, to America. They also provide streaming radio online. NPR has many programs which benefit a wide range of people, from the very young to the very old and everything in between.</p>

<p>As of late in Congress, Repulic(a/u)n(t)s (figure it out) have moved to defund the "evil" NPR and PBS and strip them of government money. All 8% of it. Yeah, thats going to make a huge dent... not. I tried to find a concise graph to illustrate this point but failed miserably. Republicants' (yeah, lets go with that), are just trying to cause a ruckus and "try to fix the economy". Psh. Good luck. George Bush fixed the economy too right... oh, wait.</p>

<p>Defund NPR and it won't hurt. I say, kick the Tea Party out of the country first. In fact, ban them. They could very well be considered a terrorist organization (Gabrielle Giffords and Sarah Palin anyone?)</p>
