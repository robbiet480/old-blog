<h1>rxt.gd landing page</h1>
<p>Wondering what you are doing here? Well, if I had to guess, you tried to go directly to <a href="http://rxt.gd">rxt.gd</a>. Was I right?
  <br/><br/>
  rxt.gd is my personal URL shortener. You can see it in action on my Twitter (@robbie). It is based on my node.js project, <a href="https://github.com/robbiet480/tweetfixer">TweetFixer</a> which replaces any and all links with my own personal links, just so that I can keep track of traffic of my links. Also, it's kind of kick-ass.
<br/><br/>
How about instead of snooping around my domains, you just go <a href="/">home</a>
